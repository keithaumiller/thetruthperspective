# News Extractor Module

**Enhanced news article processing with AI-powered analysis for The Truth Perspective platform**

## Overview

The News Extractor module is a core component of The Truth Perspective platform that automatically processes news articles through a sophisticated pipeline combining content extraction, AI analysis, and data enrichment. It transforms raw RSS feeds into fully analyzed articles with sentiment analysis, bias detection, entity recognition, and motivation classification.

## Architecture

The module follows a service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Service Architecture (Sensors ‚Üí Processors ‚Üí Levers)

- **ScrapingService** (Sensors): Diffbot API integration and content extraction
- **AIProcessingService** (Processors): Claude AI analysis and prompt building  
- **DataProcessingService** (Levers): Field updates, taxonomy management, and data formatting
- **NewsExtractionService** (Orchestrator): Coordinates all services in the processing pipeline

## Article Processing Flow After Initial Creation

### Stage 1: Entity Creation Trigger
- **File**: `news_extractor.module`
- **Function**: `news_extractor_entity_insert()`
- **Action**: Detects new article with `field_original_url` and calls orchestrator service

### Stage 2: Content Scraping (Sensors)
- **File**: `src/Service/ScrapingService.php`
- **Function**: `ScrapingService::extractContent()`
- **Actions**:
  - Makes Diffbot API call with 13-second rate limiting
  - Extracts article text, metadata, images, publication date
  - Stores complete JSON response in `field_json_scraped_article_data`
  - Updates body content and title (if empty)

### Stage 3: Metadata Updates
- **File**: `src/Service/ScrapingService.php`
- **Function**: `ScrapingService::updateMetadataFields()`
- **Actions**:
  - Extracts news source from Diffbot `siteName` (Priority 1) or URL domain (Priority 2)
  - Updates author, site name, breadcrumb, word count, language fields
  - Processes external image URL
  - Updates publication date from Diffbot data

### Stage 4: AI Analysis (Processors)
- **File**: `src/Service/AIProcessingService.php`
- **Function**: `AIProcessingService::generateAnalysis()`
- **Actions**:
  - Sends article text to AWS Bedrock Claude 3.5 Sonnet
  - Generates structured motivation analysis, bias detection, sentiment
  - Stores raw AI response in `field_ai_raw_response`

### Stage 5: Data Processing & Final Publishing (Levers)
- **File**: `src/Service/DataProcessingService.php`
- **Function**: `DataProcessingService::processAnalysisData()`
- **Actions**:
  - Parses AI response into structured fields
  - Creates taxonomy terms for entities and motivations
  - Formats motivation analysis with taxonomy links
  - Performs final entity save with complete data

### Stage 6: Post-Processors (Publishing Control)
- **File**: `src/Service/DataProcessingService.php`
- **Functions**: 
  - `postProcessPublishingStatus()` (orchestrator)
  - `postProcessScrapedDataStatus()` (checks scraping)
  - `postProcessMotivationAnalysis()` (checks AI analysis)
  - `postProcessPublishingCriteria()` (publishing criteria)
- **Actions**:
  - Checks if scraped data = "Scraped data unavailable" ‚Üí **UNPUBLISHES** article
  - Checks for "Analysis is Pending" or "No analysis data available" ‚Üí **UNPUBLISHES** article
  - **PUBLISHING CRITERIA**: If article has valid motivation analysis AND valid scraped data ‚Üí **PUBLISHES** article
  - Sets news source to "Source Unavailable" for failed articles
  - Updates analysis fields to indicate unpublished status
  - Logs publishing decisions with reasons

### Stage 7: Enhanced Automated Cleanup (Cron)
- **File**: `news_extractor.module`
- **Function**: `news_extractor_cron()` - runs automatically
- **Actions**:
  1. Checks published articles for post-processor conditions (may unpublish)
  2. Finds unpublished articles (< 3 days old) and reprocesses them through complete pipeline
  3. **Enhanced Assessment Field Maintenance**: Comprehensive statistics and reprocessing for missing assessment fields
     - **Before/After Statistics**: Detailed counts of missing authoritarianism, credibility, bias, and sentiment scores
     - **Smart Field Detection**: Identifies articles missing any assessment field in last 14 days
     - **Targeted Reprocessing**: Processes up to 15 articles per cron run with specific field gap logging
     - **Improvement Tracking**: Logs exactly how many fields were fixed per assessment type
  4. **NEW**: Detects and unlocks stuck feed imports (locked > 30 minutes)
- **Enhanced Logging**: Comprehensive statistics including field-specific improvements and total fixes counter

**Note**: Post-processors in Stage 6 run after all processing is complete to make final publishing decisions based on data quality and completeness.

## Usage

### Automatic Processing
Articles are automatically processed when:
- New articles are imported via Feeds
- Articles are created with `field_original_url`

### Manual Processing
Use Drush commands for manual operations and maintenance:

#### Comprehensive Statistics and Analysis
```bash
# Get detailed field statistics and debug information
drush ne:stats                    # Shows field existence, data availability
drush news-extractor:source-stats # Full alias

# Get processing summary with recommendations
drush ne:summary                  # Overview with next steps
drush news-extractor:summary      # Full alias
```

#### News Source Population (Primary Tasks)
```bash
# Process from JSON data (most reliable method)
drush ne:pop-sources              # Default batch size (100)
drush ne:pop-sources 50           # Custom batch size
drush ne:pop-sources --all        # Process all articles in one run
drush news-extractor:populate-sources  # Full alias

# Process from URLs (fallback method)
drush ne:pop-url                  # Default batch size (50)
drush ne:pop-url 25               # Custom batch size
drush news-extractor:populate-sources-url  # Full alias
```

#### Taxonomy Management
```bash
# Create missing taxonomy terms for existing news sources
drush ne:cmt                      # Create taxonomy terms for all news sources
drush news-extractor:create-missing-taxonomy  # Full alias

# Reprocess articles to link them to taxonomy terms
drush ne:est                      # Reprocess 20 articles (recommended after creating terms)
drush ne:est --limit=50           # Reprocess more articles
drush news-extractor:ensure-source-taxonomy  # Full alias
```

#### Smart Cleanup (Remove Unsuitable Content)
```bash
# Preview what would be deleted (recommended first step)
drush ne:cleanup --dry-run        # Shows articles that would be deleted
drush ne:cleanup --dry-run --limit=200  # Check more articles

# Actually delete unsuitable articles
drush ne:cleanup                  # Delete up to 100 articles
drush ne:cleanup --limit=500      # Delete more articles

# Full alias
drush news-extractor:cleanup      # Same functionality
```

**Automatically removes articles that are:**
- üé• **Video content** (URLs containing `/video/`)
- üìò **Facebook links** (`facebook.com` domains)
- üìÑ **PDF files** (`.pdf` extensions)
- üì± **Social media** (Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok)
- üé¨ **Video platforms** (YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion)
- üîó **Articles with no URL** (missing `field_original_url`)

> **üí° Tip**: Run `drush ne:cleanup --dry-run` first to see what would be deleted before running actual cleanup.

#### Daily Limit Management
```bash
# View current daily processing limits
drush ne:limits                   # Show today's status for all sources
drush ne:daily                    # Same as above (alias)
drush ne:limits --date=2025-01-15 # Show specific date
drush ne:limits --source="CNN"    # Show details for specific source

# Set daily limits
drush ne:set-limit "CNN" 10       # Set CNN to 10 articles per day
drush ne:set-limit "Fox News" 8   # Set Fox News to 8 articles per day
drush ne:set-limit --global 7     # Set global default to 7 articles per source

# View processing statistics
drush ne:stats                    # Show last 7 days statistics
drush ne:limit-stats 14           # Show last 14 days
drush ne:stats --format=json      # Output in JSON format

# Enable/disable daily limits
drush ne:toggle-limits enable     # Enable daily processing limits
drush ne:toggle-limits disable    # Disable daily processing limits

# Emergency reset (use with caution)
drush ne:reset-limits --confirm   # Reset today's counts for all sources
drush ne:reset-limits --date=2025-01-15 --confirm  # Reset specific date
```

#### Standard Processing
```bash
# Enhanced cron maintenance with detailed assessment field statistics
sudo -u www-data drush cron          # Run as www-data user to avoid permission issues

# Watch comprehensive cron logging in real-time
drush watchdog:tail --filter=news_extractor

# Process recent articles
drush news-extractor:process

# Bulk process with options
drush news-extractor:bulk-process --limit=50 --type=full

# Process only scraping (no AI analysis)
drush news-extractor:bulk-process --type=scrape_only

# Process only AI analysis (articles already scraped)
drush news-extractor:bulk-process --type=analyze_only

# Reprocess articles (re-run AI analysis) - now with smart cleanup
drush news-extractor:bulk-process --type=reprocess

# Check processing status
drush news-extractor:status
```

> **üßπ Smart Processing**: All bulk processing commands now automatically delete unsuitable articles (videos, PDFs, social media, etc.) instead of trying to process them, keeping your database clean and focused on actual news content.

### Processing Types

**Full Processing** (`full`): Complete pipeline from URL to analyzed article
**Scrape Only** (`scrape_only`): Diffbot extraction only, no AI analysis
**Analyze Only** (`analyze_only`): AI analysis on already scraped articles
**Reprocess** (`reprocess`): Re-run AI analysis on articles with existing data

## API Integration

### Diffbot API
- **Purpose**: Clean content extraction from news URLs
- **Benefits**: Removes ads, navigation, and extracts pure article content
- **Data**: Title, author, text, publication date, site metadata

### Claude AI API
- **Purpose**: Advanced content analysis and entity extraction
- **Capabilities**: Sentiment, bias, credibility, entities, motivations
- **Output**: Structured JSON responses for systematic data storage

## Content Filtering & Smart Cleanup

### Automatically Deleted Content
The module now automatically **deletes** (rather than processes) articles that are:

**üé• Video Content**
- URLs containing `/video/` paths
- Fox News video links, YouTube videos, etc.

**üì± Social Media Content**
- Facebook links (`facebook.com`)
- Twitter/X links (`twitter.com`) 
- Instagram links (`instagram.com`)
- LinkedIn articles (`linkedin.com`)
- TikTok links (`tiktok.com`)

**üé¨ Video Platforms**
- YouTube videos (`youtube.com`)
- Vimeo content (`vimeo.com`)
- Dailymotion videos (`dailymotion.com`)

**üìÑ Document Files**
- PDF files (`.pdf` extensions)
- Direct document downloads

**üîó Invalid Articles**
- Articles with no URL (`field_original_url` missing/empty)
- Malformed or unreachable URLs

### Traditional Content Filtering
The module also filters out content from:
- `comparecards.com`
- `fool.com` 
- `lendingtree.com`
- Articles with very short titles (< 10 characters)
- Articles with missing or empty titles

### URL Validation
- Validates article URLs before processing
- Automatically deletes invalid or unsuitable content
- Logs deleted content for review

## Data Flow

```
RSS Feed ‚Üí Feed Import ‚Üí URL Validation ‚Üí Content Filtering

    ‚Üì
Claude AI ‚Üí Sentiment Analysis ‚Üí Bias Detection ‚Üí Entity Extraction
    ‚Üì
Data Processing ‚Üí Field Updates ‚Üí Taxonomy Assignment ‚Üí Storage
```

## Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: Failed processing doesn't break the import pipeline
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations logged for debugging
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for temporary API failures
- **Status Tracking**: Processing status stored for each article

## Performance Considerations

- **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch sizes for bulk operations
- **API Rate Limiting**: Respects API rate limits and quotas
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized database queries for large datasets
- **Memory Management**: Handles large article datasets efficiently

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Log Messages
Monitor processing via Drupal logs:
- Successful extractions and analyses
- Failed operations with error details
- Skipped content with reasons
- Processing statistics

### Status Checking
```bash
# Get detailed status of recent articles
drush news-extractor:status --limit=20

# Check processing statistics
drush news-extractor:stats
```

## Integration with The Truth Perspective

This module provides the foundation data for:
- **News Motivation Metrics**: Public analytics dashboard
- **Credibility Tracking**: Source reliability analysis  
- **Bias Monitoring**: Political bias detection and trending
- **Entity Networks**: Relationship mapping between people/organizations
- **Narrative Analysis**: Story development and motivation tracking

## Development

### Service Extensions
New analysis capabilities can be added by:
1. Extending existing services or creating new ones
2. Adding new field mappings in `DataProcessingService`
3. Updating AI prompts in `AIProcessingService`
4. Registering services in `news_extractor.services.yml`

### Custom Processing
Developers can hook into the processing pipeline:
```php
// Custom processing after AI analysis
function mymodule_news_extractor_post_ai_analysis($node, $ai_response) {
  // Custom logic here
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Articles not processing:**
- Check API keys in configuration
- Verify field machine names match expectations
- Check logs for specific error messages

**Missing data:**
- Ensure all required fields exist on article content type
- Verify API responses in raw data fields
- Check field mapping in `DataProcessingService`

**Performance issues:**
- Reduce batch processing limits
- Check API rate limits and quotas
- Monitor memory usage during bulk operations

**Stuck feed imports:**
- **Symptoms**: Feeds appear to stop importing new articles
- **Cause**: Feed import process gets stuck/locked due to timeouts or errors
- **Solution**: Cron automatically detects feeds locked > 30 minutes and unlocks them
- **Manual check**: Look for "stuck feeds" messages in Drupal logs
- **Prevention**: Monitor feed import frequency and server resources

### Support

- Check Drupal logs: `/admin/reports/dblog`
- Review processing status: `drush news-extractor:status`
- Enable debug mode for detailed logging
